# Container Object Storage Provisioner Sidecar

Container Object Storage Interface (COSI) provisioner sidecar is responsible to manage lifecycle of COSI objects and is
deployed as a sidecar to a provisioner.
Specifically, the sidecar monitors the lifecycle of the CRDs generated by the [COSI Controller](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/container-object-storage-interface-controller):

- Bucket - Represents a Bucket or its equivalent in the storage backend
- BucketAccess - Represents a access token or service account in the storage backend

and makes gRPC calls to the associated provisioner.

In this repo you will also find a [sample provisioner](./cmd/sample-driver) based on Minio.

## Developer Guide

Before diving into the code of this repo, we suggest that you familiarize yourself with:

- The Spec of CRDs in [objectstorage.k8s.io/v1alpha1/types.go](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/container-object-storage-interface-api/blob/master/apis/objectstorage.k8s.io/v1alpha1/types.go)
- The Spec of the COSI objects [sigs.k8s.io/container-object-storage-interface-spec](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/container-object-storage-interface-spec)

A good starting point towards understanding the functionality of this repo would be to study the tests:

- [Bucket Controller Test](./pkg/controller/bucket/bucket_controller_test.go)
- [Bucket Access Controller Test](./pkg/controller/bucketaccess/bucket_access_controller_test.go)

### Build and Test

In order to build and generate the Docker images execute:
```bash
make container
```
Notice that this command will also generate the image for the sample-driver:
```bash
objectstorage-sidecar:latest
sample-driver:latest
```

In order to run the tests execute:
```bash
make test
```

### Running the Sidecar

To see an example of running the sidecar, take a look at the [COSI Driver Minio](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/cosi-driver-minio) sub-project.
